## Description

Redrawer recreates images by taking control of your keyboard and cursor and drawing an image on the Microsoft Paint Canvas. Before this, a couple steps are taken.

1. A palette of colors is built, expanding on the 20 default colors of Microsoft Paint, adding 10 custom colors based on color frequencies and uniqueness from the input image.
2. A processed version of the image is built, using the 30 palette colors.
3. A Microsoft Paint window is started, and the canvas, brush size, palette colors, and various other settings are initialized.
4. The processed image is "redrawn" onto the canvas
