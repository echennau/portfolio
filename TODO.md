Add hover animation to bio card, something like a scale and with a shimmer border and slight change in background

Landing should change to a cool interactive blob animation with threejs or something. Or a laser thing!!

FINISH POLISHING:

- add more blobs to everywhere. maybe randomize it?

- big slider modal idk the word thing for display projects

REWORK

The entire website, change everything to use shadcn, rework all of it, all of it.

layouts are bad, use grid more, create some tokens and use CSS variable with actual dark/light color scale,

This is basically a prototype
